# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts diamond prices based on various features like carat, cut, color, clarity, and dimensions.

---
## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses regression models to predict the price of diamonds.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The goal is to build an accurate predictive model that can estimate diamond prices from input features.
